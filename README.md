# plantuml-generator

* This project aims at making use of already working solutions in order to get the 
intended result

## Use Case

The idea is to somehow have a github repository up and running, to which one can 
commit files that hold inside of it text that represents a __plant uml diagram__, 
through a Github Action, it is expected to have all that text render an svg, and 
then have that svg comitted to the same repository right after.
